      <h2>Inspired by the Greats</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Path of Exile (1)</strong> stands proudly on the shoulders of 
        <em>Diablo II</em> — borrowing its dark tone, itemization depth, 
        and brutal gameplay loops. However, PoE took that inspiration 
        and built something far grander.
      </p>

      <h2>Why PoE is the Best</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Massive passive skill tree with thousands of builds</li>
        <li>Deep item crafting and economy-based trading</li>
        <li>Seasonal leagues with new mechanics every few months</li>
        <li>No pay-to-win elements — skill and time define mastery</li>
        <li>Gritty, atmospheric world true to the ARPG spirit</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diablo II’s Spirit Lives On</h2>
      <p>
        Path of Exile recaptures that magic feeling of exploration, danger, 
        and discovery — all while staying true to the principles that made 
        <em>Diablo II</em> legendary.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “PoE isn’t just inspired by Diablo II — it’s its spiritual successor.”
